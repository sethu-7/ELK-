#Development of rest client interface for elk server

The objective is to design an intuitive user interface that presents the valuable data collected from a network of sensors and actuators deployed in an agricultural environment. This interface will serve as a comprehensive platform, offering easy access to crucial information and insights related to the agricultural processes and conditions. By presenting the data in an organized and user-friendly manner, farmers and agricultural stakeholders will be able to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, and enhance overall productivity in the agricultural setting. The user interface will act as a bridge between the complex data from the sensors and the end-users, making it simpler for them to interact with and understand the agricultural environment's dynamics.

We have chosen Flutter as the front-end interface for its cross-platform capabilities and rich widget library, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. On the backend, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) will handle data processing. Elasticsearch will store and index data, and Logstash will facilitate data ingestion, enabling data-driven decisions in agriculture.
